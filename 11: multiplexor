Check Text:
Verify the audit event multiplexor is configured to offload audit records to a different system or storage media from the system being audited. 
 
Check that audisp-remote plugin is installed: 
 
$ sudo dpkg -s audispd-plugins 
 
If status is "not installed", this is a finding. 
 
Check that the records are being offloaded to a remote server with the following command: 
 
$ sudo grep -i active /etc/audisp/plugins.d/au-remote.conf 
 
active = yes 
 
If "active" is not set to "yes", or the line is commented out, this is a finding. 
 
Check that audisp-remote plugin is configured to send audit logs to a different system: 
 
$ sudo grep -i ^remote_server /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf  
 
remote_server = 192.168.122.126 
 
If the "remote_server" parameter is not set, is set with a local address, or is set with an invalid address, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Configure the audit event multiplexor to offload audit records to a different system or storage media from the system being audited. 
 
Install the audisp-remote plugin: 
 
$ sudo apt-get install audispd-plugins -y 
 
Set the audisp-remote plugin as active by editing the "/etc/audisp/plugins.d/au-remote.conf" file: 
 
$ sudo sed -i -E 's/active\s*=\s*no/active = yes/' /etc/audisp/plugins.d/au-remote.conf 
 
Set the address of the remote machine by editing the "/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf" file: 
 
$ sudo sed -i -E 's/(remote_server\s*=).*/\1 <remote addr>/' /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf 
 
where <remote addr> must be substituted by the address of the remote server receiving the audit log. 
 
Make the audit service reload its configuration files: 
 
$ sudo systemctl restart auditd.service
