Verify the Ubuntu operating system prevents passwords from being reused for a minimum of five generations by running the following command:

$ grep -i remember /etc/pam.d/common-password

password [success=1 default=ignore] pam_unix.so obscure sha512 shadow remember=5 rounds=5000

If the "remember" parameter value is not greater than or equal to "5", is commented out, or is not set at all, this is a finding.
