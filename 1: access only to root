# Verify the operating system is configured to restrict access to the kernel message buffer with the following commands:

     $ sudo sysctl kernel.dmesg_restrict
     kernel.dmesg_restrict = 1

# If "kernel.dmesg_restrict" is not set to "1" or is missing, this is a finding.

# Check that the configuration files are present to enable this kernel parameter:

     $ sudo grep -r kernel.dmesg_restrict /run/sysctl.d/* /etc/sysctl.d/* /usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/* /usr/lib/sysctl.d/* /lib/sysctl.d/* /etc/sysctl.conf 2> /dev/null
     /etc/sysctl.conf:kernel.dmesg_restrict = 1
     /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf:kernel.dmesg_restrict = 1

# If "kernel.dmesg_restrict" is not set to "1", is missing or commented out, this is a finding.

# If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.
## Fix Text:
#Configure the operating system to restrict access to the kernel message buffer.

#Set the system to the required kernel parameter by adding or modifying the following line in /etc/sysctl.conf or a config file in the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory:

     kernel.dmesg_restrict = 1

#Remove any configurations that conflict with the above from the following locations: 
     /run/sysctl.d/
     /etc/sysctl.d/
     /usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/
     /usr/lib/sysctl.d/
     /lib/sysctl.d/
     /etc/sysctl.conf

#Reload settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

     $ sudo sysctl --system
