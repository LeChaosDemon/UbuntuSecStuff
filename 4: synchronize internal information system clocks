Check Text:
Verify the operating system synchronizes internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than one second. 
 
Check the value of "makestep" by running the following command: 
 
$ sudo grep makestep /etc/chrony/chrony.conf 
 
makestep 1 -1 
 
If the makestep option is commented out or is not set to "1 -1", this is a finding.
